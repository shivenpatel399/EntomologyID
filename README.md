# ENTO ID BOT

This is a bot created to identify different bugs for the Science Olympiad Event, Entomology.
It consists of picture identification of different bugs where when you run an image command, it outputs an image and you have to identify what bug it is.

## Manual
To ask for an image, type b.i 

To answer, type b.a [insert answer here]. Make sure to add dashes between spaces 

To skip, type b.s

To get a new image of the insect, use b.p 

To ask for a hint, use b.h and specify if you want the number of letters, the first letter, or the last letter

## Turning On the Bot

DM @shivpat._. on discord if you want me to turn on the bot. It will take about 1-2 minutes to turn it on.

## Privacy and Security

In the main.py code, the code will show about 5-7 lines. Due to the Security Protocol, I am not allowed to reveal the token used for the bot. However, I have attached a file of my code **WITHOUT** the token for public view.
